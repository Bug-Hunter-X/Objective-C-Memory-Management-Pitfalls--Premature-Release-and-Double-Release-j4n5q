# Objective-C Memory Management Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates common memory management issues in Objective-C, specifically focusing on the pitfalls of using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` incorrectly.  Premature object deallocation can lead to crashes or memory leaks, and this example highlights how to avoid them.

## The Problem

The primary issues shown are:

* **Premature Release:** Releasing an object before it is no longer needed by other parts of the application.
* **Double Release:** Releasing an object multiple times, causing a crash.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates proper memory management using the principles of retain count and autorelease pools, avoiding potential issues with memory leaks or crashes.
