In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider the following example:

```objectivec
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... some code using myObject ...
[myObject release]; // Error: Potential memory leak
```

This code allocates `myObject` but doesn't properly manage its lifecycle. If `myObject` is used by other objects that retain it, releasing it here would lead to a double-release, causing a crash. If no other object retains it, prematurely releasing `myObject` causes a memory leak.

Another problem is with using `autorelease` inappropriately within a class method:

```objectivec
+ (MyObject*) createObject {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    return [obj autorelease]; //Error:Autoreleased object might be released prematurely.
}
```

Returning an autoreleased object from a class method is problematic. The autorelease pool might be drained before the calling method finishes using the object. This results in a potential crash or unexpected behavior.
